R programming 

Quiz 1 
=======

1) R was developed by statisticians working at
Answer===The University of Auckland

2)The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.
Answer===The freedom to sell the software for any price.

3)In R the following are all atomic data types EXCEPT: (Select all that apply)
Answer===matrix

Explaination---->Matrix is not a atomic data types of R.

4)If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?
Answer===numeric

Explaination---->
> x<-4L
> x
[1] 4
> 
> class(4)
[1] "numeric"
> 

5)What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?
Answer===character

Explaination---->
x<-c(4,"a",TRUE)
> 
> x
[1] "4"    "a"    "TRUE"
> class(x)
[1] "character"
> 

6)If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
Answer====a matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows

Explaination---->
column bind converts the rows of vectors x and y to respective column.The output will look more or less like 
> x<-c(1,3,5)
> y<-c(3,2,10)
> cbind(x,y)
     x  y
[1,] 1  3
[2,] 3  2
[3,] 5 10

7)A key property of vectors in R is that
Answer====elements of a vector all must be of the same class

8)Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.
Answer====a character vector containing the letter "a".

Explaination---->
unlike in arrays the list usually start with 1st position...here the 2nd element in the list is displayed

9)Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and y <- 2:3. What is produced by the expression x + y?
Answer====an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.

Explaination---->
> x
[1] 1 2 3 4
> y<-2:3
> y
[1] 2 3
> z<-x+y
> class(z)
[1] "integer"
